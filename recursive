param n: The number of floors in the egg drop tower
param min_goes: the min number of goes to find the floor at which an egg breaks.
returns min_goes: int
Function works recursively to find the min_goes to find the point at which eggs start breaking for a given tower height
1st drop is at floor level (min_goes): assume it breaks then the second egg is dropped from every level below it ie. min_goes -1 : total=min_goes
If the egg doesn't break on the first_drop then we still want the same number of min_goes for futher attemps. Therefore the next level to drop egg 1 from is 
min_goes + (min_goes - 1 attempt) etc etc
